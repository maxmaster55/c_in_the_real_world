## Useful Info (Important)

1. the compiler is called __gcc__ short for (GNU Compiler Collection).
1. __folders__ are called __directories__.
1. using the cmd or the terminal is far better than using an __IDE__, at least in c.
1. makefiles are a tool used to help you compile with more options, will learn about it in __ex3__.
1. hints are in the hints directory .
1. __don't give up fast__ .

## How to compile

- make sure you have the compiler installed locally
- you can get it by searching for "gcc for windows"
go into the directory you are working in and type.
- you can also search on youtube
